# PredictingBloodDonations
The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different  universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. The model predicts whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the mobile blood donation vehicle comes to campus. Project done while working as a Data Analyst Trainee in MedTourEasy.
